The workshop will include 4 invited talks, 2 of which are by early-career researchers (ECRs). All speakers are confirmed; 2 of them will attend in person, while 2 others are also interested in doing so. The talks will cover several topics ranging from lifelong learning in reinforcement learning, to Bayesian and generative models, and applications to computer vision.
We will also have a session with contributed and lightning talks, where we will feature some of the papers that were submitted. The talks will be grouped in terms of some research themes, which may provide a way to facilitate collaborations among the attendees. A 30 minute discussion will allow the speakers, organisers, and attendees to discuss possible ways to boost research on this topic. One main topic to discuss will be to increase organisation of similar events at the other ML conferences, focusing primarily on Asian researchers.

**The precise workshop schedule will be updated soon.**
