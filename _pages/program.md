# Program

The workshop will include 4 invited talks. The talks will cover several topics ranging from lifelong learning in reinforcement learning, to Bayesian and generative models, and applications to computer vision.
We will also have a session with contributed and lightning talks, where we will feature some of the papers that were submitted. A 30 minute discussion will allow the speakers, organisers, and attendees to discuss possible ways to boost research on this topic. One main topic to discuss will be to increase organisation of similar events at the other ML conferences, focusing primarily on Asian researchers.

**The precise workshop schedule will be updated soon.**
